This is the CloudNet project, which has spared a lot of time and effort for over 6 months. 
Here you can find the most recent commits of the project. 
I am absolutely not satisfied with the code and find it horribly awful. 
Therefore, there will soon be a third CloudNet architecture.

CloudNet is a cloud computing service for Minecraft networks. With a wide range of functionality, it offers both Minecraft Server (Craftbukkit / Spigot / Glowstone) and BungeeCord.

CloudNet is dynamic, which means that the software automates and "limits" many already clear functionalities based on the pre-configuration or the "CloudDynamicServices" (CDS 2.1)

CloudNet is to be the manager and network extension with new technologies the administration of a Minecraft network to the side. The second direction is the unlimited development possibility with its own modules, and extensive programming interfaces.
Support for a wide range of needs and future opportunities, such as support for a Round Robin DNS management with the CloudFlare company service and the multi-proxy functionality for networks with more than 500 players, the project is important to enable high performance and stabilization for a Minecraft network.
